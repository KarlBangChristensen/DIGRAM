# DIGRAM

DIGRAM is a stand alone software package running under windows (*.exe file). This repository contains SAS macros that can be used to export data to DIGRAM, create batch files, submit batch files to DIGRAM, and read DIGRAM output files.


## Example

To do item analysis using DIGRAM you need to download the file scd.exe and save it `c:\dropbox\GRM`. Consider a data set containing 8 items and two exogenous variables (person factors):

```
